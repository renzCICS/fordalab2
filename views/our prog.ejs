            Since we are still a growing organization, we could only shelter a few of these stray animals. 
             Mostly will be those who need treatments and medications until they are claimed by their new family.

            <h1> Feeding</h1>
        <p>There are over 12 million stray dogs and cats in the Philippines and there are thousands of them each year that are dying because of hunger. 
            We vow to continue feeding stray animals each day in various places of Manila.

        <h1> Anti-Rabies</h1>
        <p>
            There are over 200 human deaths in the Philippines every year due to rabies exposure. The best way to prevent canine rabies is by giving these dogs and cats yearly vaccination as much as possible.

            <h1> Tick and Fleas Prevention</h1>
        <p>The most common skin and blood disease of dogs and cats are caused by ticks and fleas. Preventive medications are the best way to combat these parasites and the disease that accompany them and our team wishes to provide long-term tick and flea control for these stray animals.

            <h1> Spay & Neuter</h1>
            <p>
                One of our advocacies is to fight against stray overpopulation. Spaying and neutering stray cats and dogs will significantly decrease the number of strays in communities. The sterilization of animals does not only improve their health by minimizing the risk of different diseases, but it also reduces the cost of feeding and housing the strays, and the number of euthanizations that have to happen in overpopulated facilities.
